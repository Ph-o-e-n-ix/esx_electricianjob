Hey, This is a Script for an Electrician Job, that a Player allows to take a custom Car, go out with it and do some Repairds. 

The Target Locations are based on Coordinates, so you can add much as you want. Its taking the Locations randomly everytime you 
repaired one Location.

So you drive around and you repairing stuff like, as example Phone Booth or a Power Box


Also works with the Minigame
