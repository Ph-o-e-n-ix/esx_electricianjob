Hey, This is a Script for an Electrician Job, that a Player allows to take a custom Car, go out with it and do some Repairds. 

The Target Locations are based on Coordinates, so you can add much as you want. Its taking the Locations randomly everytime you 
repaired one Location.

So you drive around and you repairing stuff like, as example Phone Booth or a Power Box

----
**IMPORTANT**
**If you use a Car like Burrito, you have to do some Changes. The Burrito has no Trunk, instead he have Back Rear Doors. So you have to go to**

**client.lua Line 106-139**

Also works with the Minigames, but if you dont want to use them, you can deactivate it in the Config.
You can also edit the Code for yourself but not for Releasing. Thanks
